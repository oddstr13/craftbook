CraftBook
===========

CraftBook adds mechanisms (bridges, gates), redstone additions
(integrated circuits, programmable logic chips), and minecart enhancements
to Minecraft SMP (multiplayer)

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org). Once installed,
simply run:

    mvn clean package

Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work,
be sure to add Maven to your "PATH".
